# Valid Sources of Time Zone Information
#
#  The timezone file lists supported timezones for the iTV Voting Platform
#  Admin as Olson IDs. The authoratative list of Olson IDs is available at
#  the CLDR sub-project of the Unicode Consortium:
#
#   http://unicode.org/cldr/data/charts/supplemental/territory_containment_un_m_49.html
#
#  The following table summarizes the timezone names and the corresponding
#  timezone offsets, as well as the daylight savings time rules.

# Invalid Sources of Time Zone Information
#
#  WARNING:
#
#   The U.S. Government publishes timezone information that is grossly
#   inaccurate. Links to this information are prominently displayed at a number
#   of sites publishing other timezone information. In particular, avoid any
#   timezone information published by the U.S. Navy or CIA; these sources of
#   timezone data generally rank among the least trustworthy of sources.
#
# Selection Criteria
#
#  Selection criteria for timezone ids is sensitive to local rules for daylight
#  savings time. Before selecting a timezone from the the CLDR source, verify
#  its daylight savings time rules to ensure that they match your expectations.
#  Failure to do so may result in a scheduling err of one hour.
#
# Timezone File Format
#
#  This timezone file is a timezone list, where one timezone may be enterred
#  per line. Comment lines are permissible and start with a pound (#) character.
