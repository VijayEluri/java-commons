This project contains utility classes for Java development that I have open-sourced
under the Apache 2.0 License to the Java community. I have an extensive library of
utility classes which I have not yet elected to open-source, but over time I may do
so. At this time I am releasing this source so to benefit my current employer, Iron
Mountain, with the express interest so developers there can leverage it.
